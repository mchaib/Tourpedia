# Tourpedia
TourPedia is the Wikipedia of Tourism. It contains information about accommodations, restaurants, points of interest and attractions of different places in Europe. At the moment only eight places are covered: Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Dubai, London, Paris, Rome and Tuscany. However, the idea is to extend the service to all the world.  Data are extracted from four social media: Facebook, Foursquare, Google Places and Booking. They were elaborated and integrated in order to build a unique catalogue.
